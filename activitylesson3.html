<p style="font-size:100%;""font-family:calibri;"> The children were hungry. They looked out the window. Where was their mother? She 
walked into the house. The children ran over to her. “Mama, we’re so hungry,” they both 
said. <br><br>

<p style="font-size:100%;">"font-family:calibri;"> She said lunch was coming. She walked into the kitchen. She opened a can of chicken soup. 
She poured the soup into a pot. She added water. She put the pot on the stove. She made 
two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She sliced an apple. The soup was hot.<br><br>

<p style="font-size:100%;">"font-family:calibri;"> She poured it into two bowls. She put the sandwiches on two plates. She put apple slices on 
each plate. She put the bowls and plates on the table. The children ran to the table. “Thank 
you, mommy!” they said. Then they started eating. The cat and the dog watched them eat.<r><br>
