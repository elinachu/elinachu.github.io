<pre style="font-size:100%;""font-family:arial;" "span style=forte""hungry</span> The children were hungry. They looked out the window. Where was their mother? She <br>
walked into the house. The children ran over to her. “Mama, we’re so hungry,” they both <br>
said.</p>

<p style="font-size:100%;""font-family:calibri(body);"> She said lunch was coming. She walked into the kitchen. She opened a can of chicken soup. <br>
She poured the soup into a pot. She added water. She put the pot on the stove. She made <br>
two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She sliced an apple. The soup was hot. </p>

<p style="font-size:100%;""font-family:calibri(body);"> She poured it into two bowls. She put the sandwiches on two plates. She put apple slices on 
<br> each plate. She put the bowls and plates on the table. The children ran to the table. “Thank <br>
you, mommy!” they said. Then they started eating. The cat and the dog watched them eat. </pre>
