</h2>
<p>
The children were <span style="font-family:forte">hungry</span>. They looked out the window. Where was their mother? She
</p>
<p>
walked into the house. The children ran over to her. “Mama, we’re so 
<span style="font-family:forte">hungry</span>," they both 
<br>
<br>
said.
<br>
</p>
<p>
She said lunch was coming. She walked into the kitchen. She opened a can of chicken soup.
<br>
<br>
She poured the soup into a pot. She added water. She put the pot on the stove. She made 
</p>
<p>
two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She sliced an apple. The soup was 
<span style="font-family:forte">hot.</span>
</p>
<p>
She poured it into two bowls. She put the sandwiches on two plates. She put apple slices on 
<br>
each plate. She put the bowls and plates on the table. The children ran to the table. “Thank 
<br>
you, mommy!” they said. Then they started eating. The cat and the dog watched them eat.
